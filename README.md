Tora is a [Gosu](http://gosu-lang.github.io/) extension library that allows for seamless interaction with javascript resources, leveraging Gosu's Open Type System and the [Java Nashorn](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/) project.

The library supports the use of javascript programs from Gosu, the use of ES6-flavored javascript classes from Gosu, the use of Gosu (and Java) classes from javascript, as well as the creation of type-safe javascript expressions for use in Java or Gosu, as a scripting layer.

This library is sponsored and supported by [Guidewire Software](http://www.guidewire.com)
